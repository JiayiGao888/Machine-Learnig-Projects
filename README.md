# Machine Learning Projects Practice Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks focused on practicing various machine learning techniques. Each notebook is designed to demonstrate the implementation and usage of different algorithms and methodologies in the field of machine learning. CUNY Tech Prep is the contributor for making the outline of these notebooks.

## Notebooks

### 1.Linear_Regression_Practice.ipynb

In this notebook, the focus is on Linear Regression, a fundamental supervised learning algorithm used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The notebook demonstrates how to implement and evaluate linear regression models.

### Logistic-Regression-Practice.ipynb

Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm used to model the probability of a binary outcome. This notebook provides an introduction to logistic regression, its implementation, and evaluation metrics for binary classification tasks.

### 3. Decision_Tree_and_Random_Forest_Practice.ipynb

This notebook explores the concepts and implementation of Decision Trees and Random Forest algorithms. Decision Trees are used for classification and regression tasks, while Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training.

### 4. NLP-practice.ipynb

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence concerned with the interaction between computers and human languages. This notebook delves into various NLP techniques such as tokenization, text preprocessing, and sentiment analysis.
